# Reporting Automation

Automated reporting ensures the risk committee receives daily exposure summaries, limit breaches, and market data quality metrics.

## Daily report workflow
1. The GitHub Actions workflow `Build OCI Images` uploads SBOMs and artifacts.
2. A scheduled cron job (see script below) pulls Prometheus metrics and aggregates them into a CSV summary.
3. The script emails the summary to `risk-committee@aether.dev` and uploads it to the GRC drive.

## Execution schedule
- Runs at 06:00 UTC every trading day (Mondayâ€“Friday) using Kubernetes CronJobs.
- CronJob definition references the container image built from `scripts/daily_report.py` packaged into the risk-ops toolbox image.

## Validation checks
- Confirms Prometheus SLO queries return data within 30 seconds.
- Ensures exported CSV contains at least the BTC, ETH, and SOL universes defined in `docs/config/universe-controls.yaml`.
- Verifies Loki log exports succeed for the prior 24-hour window to detect ingest gaps.

## Escalation
If the script exits with a non-zero status:
1. PagerDuty notifies the reporting on-call rotation.
2. Run `kubectl logs job/daily-risk-report` to identify the failing step.
3. Re-run manually:
   ```bash
   python docs/runbooks/scripts/daily_report.py --date $(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
   ```
