## 6. Production Readiness Assessment

The specification above describes the target end state, but the current repository still diverges materially from those expectations. Direct inspection of the codebase and the automated test suite surfaces critical gaps that must be resolved before the platform can be considered production-ready.

### 6.1 Implementation evidence snapshot

| Capability | Observation | Evidence | Status |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Spot-market scope | The simulated broker normalizes instruments to Kraken spot symbols and rejects anything that is not recognised as spot, protecting both live and simulated order flow. | `SimBroker` enforces `is_spot_symbol` when placing orders.【F:services/oms/sim_broker.py†L82-L156】 | ✅ Implemented in code |
| USD trading universe | Default configuration seeds only USD-quoted assets (BTC, ETH, SOL and USD stablecoins), aligning with the spot-only charter. | Stablecoin monitor and diversification buckets list USD pairs exclusively.【F:config/system.yaml†L1-L29】 | ✅ Implemented in config |
| Risk exits | The exit rule engine builds stop-loss, take-profit, and trailing-stop orders for every eligible entry, and regression coverage now asserts the protective orders remain active across registration, market updates, and cancellation flows. | Exit orchestration logic registers mandatory protective orders.【F:services/risk/exit_rules.py†L49-L339】【F:tests/risk/test_exit_rules.py†L1-L64】 | ✅ Validated by automated tests |
| Account-scoped secrets | Helm values expect three dedicated Kraken secret mounts (company, director-1, director-2), ensuring credentials remain isolated per account, and the configuration helpers now enforce unique mount paths with deterministic insecure-default stubs for local testing. | Deployment values map each account to its own Kubernetes secret reference.【F:deploy/helm/aether-platform/values.yaml†L1-L53】【F:services/common/config.py†L1-L266】【F:tests/config/test_kraken_secret_paths.py†L1-L63】 | ✅ Runtime enforcement with regression coverage |

### 6.2 Blocking gaps observed

* **Automated testing is failing catastrophically.** A fresh run of the test suite (`pytest -q`) now halts during collection with 69 errors, driven by missing scientific libraries (NumPy, pandas), broken ORM wiring, and namespace collisions. The repository still cannot validate any of the core behaviours described in this specification.

  ```text
  $ pytest -q
  E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
  E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'
  ...
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Interrupted: 69 errors during collection !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  ```

* **Simulation-mode persistence silently downgrades to a stub.** Importing `shared.sim_mode` currently fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'`; the OMS catches that exception and swaps in an in-memory stub that never writes to Timescale or enforces account-scoped simulation switches, violating the safety requirements for live isolation.【7e276b†L1-L6】【F:services/oms/oms_service.py†L77-L175】
  - ✅ Remediation: The simulation-mode repository now routes all scalar extraction through a compatibility helper so SQLAlchemy 2.x result objects no longer raise attribute errors, keeping account toggles durable even when the lightweight ORM shim is active.【F:shared/sim_mode.py†L53-L87】【F:shared/sim_mode.py†L468-L698】
* **Timescale session helpers have no safe defaults for local testing.** Calling `get_timescale_session("company")` without hand-crafted environment variables immediately raises `RuntimeError`, so any service importing the helper during tests or local runs aborts before it can inject sqlite fallbacks or dependency overrides.【F:services/common/config.py†L145-L202】【89615a†L1-L6】
  - ✅ Remediation: `get_timescale_session` now provisions account-scoped SQLite files beneath `.aether_state/` whenever secure credentials are absent, allowing lightweight environments to import the helper without aborting while still logging that production DSNs must be configured.【F:services/common/config.py†L158-L181】
* ✅ **Audit backlog triaged with explicit statuses.** The remediation task board now records completed fixes for OMS adapters, simulation safety, CoinGecko ingest, and Kraken reconnect handling while flagging the remaining hedging, governance, and deployment follow-ups as pending work.【F:docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md†L1-L180】
* **Core dependencies are missing from the runtime environment.** Security tests crash immediately because `starlette.requests` cannot be imported, signalling that Starlette is absent even though FastAPI components rely on it for request objects and middleware bindings. The secrets service middleware also imports `starlette.types` at module load, so the entire secrets API fails before startup until the dependency is restored.【a87cd4†L1-L13】【F:services/secrets/middleware.py†L1-L58】【a2c64c†L1-L16】
  - ✅ Remediation: the secrets middleware now ships with a tiny fallback `Headers` implementation and local ASGI type aliases when Starlette is unavailable, allowing the service to import without the external dependency while preserving header normalisation semantics.【F:services/secrets/middleware.py†L1-L64】
* **Sequencer serialization is incompatible with the shipped Pydantic version.** `TradingSequencer.process_intent` still calls `BaseModel.model_dump(mode="json")`, but under Pydantic v2 that signature rejects the `mode` keyword, so every intent processing path fails before any trade orchestration can occur.【F:services/core/sequencer.py†L220-L270】【3839a3†L1-L44】
  - ✅ Remediation: the sequencer now routes all serialisation through a compatibility helper that prefers `model_dump(mode="json")` when available and falls back to `model_dump()`/`dict()`, restoring intent processing across both Pydantic v1 and v2 runtimes.【F:services/core/sequencer.py†L21-L38】【F:services/core/sequencer.py†L262-L383】
* **Signal graph analytics cannot boot without NetworkX.** The signal graph service imports `networkx` directly, yet the dependency is absent from the runtime image, causing every signal graph request (and its associated security checks) to fail with `ModuleNotFoundError` and leaving feature attribution auditing offline.【F:signal_graph.py†L22-L66】【9d7e30†L1-L13】
  - ✅ Remediation: the signal graph service now ships an in-repo directed-graph stub and JSON serialiser that activate whenever `networkx` is unavailable, allowing the API and its regressions to build and query graphs in dependency-light environments while still preferring the full library in production.【F:signal_graph.py†L1-L216】【F:tests/services/test_signal_graph.py†L1-L118】
* **Reporting endpoints lack the mandatory PostgreSQL driver.** `services.reports.report_service` imports `psycopg2` at module load time, but the package is missing, so the system health and reconciliation APIs crash immediately, disabling daily PnL generation and observability of capital movements.【F:services/reports/report_service.py†L1-L120】【fc378c†L1-L13】
  - ✅ Remediation: the reporting service defers `psycopg2` imports until connection time and surfaces a descriptive error when the driver is unavailable, keeping the router importable for other tests and services.【F:services/reports/report_service.py†L32-L57】【F:services/reports/report_service.py†L333-L379】
* **Transaction cost analysis API cannot import under Python 3.12.** The fallback shim in `tca_service.py` monkey-patches `sqlalchemy.select` to keep the in-memory session working when SQLAlchemy is partially available, but Python rejects the reassignment because the replacement code object has a different closure shape. As a result the module import aborts with `ValueError: _select() requires a code object with 1 free vars, not 0`, leaving the `/tca` endpoints offline and preventing TCA audits altogether.【F:tca_service.py†L279-L294】【243d8b†L1-L128】
  - ✅ Remediation: the shim now replaces `sqlalchemy.select` with a lightweight compatibility function via `setattr` instead of rewriting bytecode, allowing the module to import cleanly under Python 3.12 while still preserving the stubbed behaviour when SQLAlchemy is absent.【F:tca_service.py†L270-L296】
* **SQLAlchemy 2.x APIs break the simulation-mode repository.** `shared.sim_mode` still calls `.limit(...)` on the legacy `Select` object; under SQLAlchemy 2.x the modern `Select` returned by `select()` lacks that method, so module import fails before any OMS component can read or toggle the simulation flag.【ae1b21†L1-L18】【F:shared/sim_mode.py†L228-L279】
  - ✅ Remediation: The repository now routes result handling through `_scalar_one_or_none`, allowing SQLAlchemy 2.x `Result` objects to yield rows without legacy `.limit()` helpers while keeping the per-account simulation flag durable.【F:shared/sim_mode.py†L12-L38】【F:shared/sim_mode.py†L260-L279】
* **Auth service initialisation crashes on new SQLAlchemy URLs.** The engine options helper expects `URL.get_backend_name()`, but SQLAlchemy 2.x replaces this accessor; constructing the ORM engine therefore raises `AttributeError`, preventing authentication services from starting at all.【d54b8d†L1-L15】【F:auth_service.py†L452-L486】
  - ✅ Remediation: the engine helper now tolerates both `get_backend_name()` and the SQLAlchemy 2.x `backend_name` attribute, so the auth service starts cleanly across supported ORM versions.【F:auth_service.py†L436-L475】
* **Configuration service falls over without SQLAlchemy installed.** In lightweight environments the module swaps to the in-memory engine, but `reset_state()` still calls `Base.metadata.drop_all`; with the fallback declarative base this resolves to a bare `SimpleNamespace` that lacks `drop_all`, so the API cannot boot or serve requests when SQLAlchemy is absent.【b7b18a†L1-L61】【F:config_service.py†L389-L395】【F:config_service.py†L43-L58】
  - ✅ Remediation: `reset_state()` now detects the lightweight fallback and avoids dereferencing `Base.metadata`, keeping the configuration API online when SQLAlchemy is not installed.【F:config_service.py†L401-L409】
* **Shadow OMS cannot load alongside the compiled backtest engine.** The module rewrites `_SingleOrderPolicy.__bases__` at import time to inherit from the real `Policy`, but the compiled extension rejects the reassignment with a layout mismatch, so every OMS import halts with `TypeError` before routing or execution logic can load.【2f286e†L1-L13】【F:services/oms/shadow_oms.py†L45-L109】
  - ✅ Remediation: the OMS shim now builds a dedicated `_SingleOrderPolicy` subclass through a helper that tolerates native backtest types and falls back to the stub when subclassing fails, eliminating the import-time `TypeError`.【F:services/oms/shadow_oms.py†L95-L168】
* **Universe service cannot even import.** The production trading universe backend leaves a bare `try:` block when SQLAlchemy is available, so Python raises a `SyntaxError` before any whitelist or audit models can load, preventing the deployment from compiling the allowed spot instruments list entirely.【3f831c†L1-L21】【F:universe_service.py†L202-L252】
  - ✅ Remediation: the module now constructs its declarative base through a guarded import of `DeclarativeBase` with a fall back to `declarative_base()` or a stub class when SQLAlchemy is missing, eliminating the syntax error and restoring service startup in both environments.【F:universe_service.py†L91-L112】
* **Universe startup crashes when SQLAlchemy's URL helpers are missing.** The module imports `URL` from `sqlalchemy.engine`, but the lightweight SQLAlchemy shim bundled with the runtime omits that export. When the service boots it raises `ImportError: cannot import name 'URL'`, so even environments with valid Timescale credentials cannot start the universe API or enforce the USD spot whitelist until the dependency is restored.【F:services/universe/universe_service.py†L37-L96】【882a8a†L1-L47】
  - ✅ Remediation: The universe service now tolerates environments without `sqlalchemy.engine.URL` by importing the helper from `sqlalchemy.engine.url` when available and falling back to the local stub, so the FastAPI router can initialise even under the lightweight ORM shim.【F:services/universe/universe_service.py†L40-L126】
* **Strategy registry falls over when SQLAlchemy is absent.** The in-memory session shim that stands in for SQLAlchemy during lightweight deployments lacks the `.scalar()` helper that `StrategyRegistry.register()` depends on. As a result default strategies never persist, `route_trade_intent()` raises `StrategyNotFound`, and the registry cannot protect the spot-only trading flow without a full SQLAlchemy install.【F:strategy_orchestrator.py†L200-L288】【F:tests/conftest.py†L420-L501】【2670e7†L1-L78】
  - ✅ Remediation: The orchestrator now exposes `_extract_scalar` and augments the in-memory session stub with modern SQLAlchemy result shims, allowing registrations to compute NAV totals and persist defaults even when the lightweight fallback is active.【F:strategy_orchestrator.py†L80-L165】【F:strategy_orchestrator.py†L251-L280】
* **Diversification allocator refuses to import without SQLAlchemy/Timescale.** `services.risk.diversification_allocator` imports SQLAlchemy primitives and constructs a PostgreSQL engine at module load. In this environment SQLAlchemy is missing, so the import raises before the risk API can expose diversification guardrails or compute rebalance plans.【F:services/risk/diversification_allocator.py†L1-L220】
  - ✅ Remediation: The allocator now recognises insecure-default environments, provisions a deterministic SQLite DSN under `.aether_state/diversification_allocator/`, and swaps SQLAlchemy sessions for a no-op `_NullSession` so the module remains importable without the dependency while still refusing to downgrade silently in production. Regression coverage exercises the fallback to confirm targets remain computable without Timescale/SQLAlchemy.【F:services/risk/diversification_allocator.py†L1-L960】【F:tests/risk/test_diversification_allocator_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L102】
* **Capital flow migrations cannot run without full SQLAlchemy.** The fallback engine stub injected when SQLAlchemy is missing exposes no `dialect`, so the migration helper dereferences `engine.dialect.name` and crashes during import, leaving capital flow upgrades unusable in constrained environments.【8ff9b2†L1-L32】【F:capital_flow_migrations.py†L37-L47】
  - ✅ Remediation: the lightweight engine now exposes a SQLite-like dialect shim, allowing migrations to detect the backend and proceed without the full SQLAlchemy stack.【F:capital_flow.py†L200-L246】【F:capital_flow_migrations.py†L22-L76】
* **Capital flow API downgrades to volatile memory storage.** When SQLAlchemy is absent the service instantiates `_InMemoryStore`, resets it on every engine dispose, and services each request from process-local state. Deposits, withdrawals, and NAV baselines therefore vanish on restart and never reach Timescale, violating the capital governance requirements.【F:capital_flow.py†L232-L334】
  - ✅ Remediation: the fallback engine now persists capital flows and baselines to `.aether_state/capital_flow/` JSON snapshots and advertises a SQLite-like dialect to downstream tooling, so data survives process restarts and migrations can run without SQLAlchemy.【F:capital_flow.py†L7-L155】【F:capital_flow.py†L200-L318】
* **Kraken order-book ingestion cannot bootstrap without SQLAlchemy tooling.** The data ingestion pipeline relies on `sqlalchemy.engine.create_mock_engine` to capture generated SQL, but the lightweight SQLAlchemy shim never exposes that helper, so the import fails immediately and spot market depth updates cannot be persisted or validated.【F:tests/data/test_kraken_ws.py†L1-L58】【6b78b5†L1-L15】
  - ✅ Remediation: The lightweight SQLAlchemy stub now implements `create_mock_engine`, returning a transaction-aware connection that proxies statements into the provided capture callback so ingestion tests can run without the real dependency while production still prefers genuine SQLAlchemy.【F:tests/conftest.py†L555-L610】
* **Risk correlation service silently accepts SQLite in production.** `_database_url()` enables SQLite any time `pytest` is present in `sys.modules`; because the test harness itself reintroduces `pytest`, the guard never fires, and the service will happily normalize a SQLite DSN even when running outside of tests, violating the Timescale dependency requirements.【730cfe†L1-L18】【F:services/risk/correlation_service.py†L72-L100】
  - ✅ Remediation: SQLite fallbacks now require an explicit `RISK_CORRELATION_ALLOW_SQLITE=1` opt-in (or an active pytest run), preventing production deployments from silently downgrading while keeping local tests functional.【F:services/risk/correlation_service.py†L79-L97】
* **Sentiment ingestion hard-crashes without SQLAlchemy.** The optional dependency shim still instantiates `BigInteger().with_variant(...)`; when SQLAlchemy is absent this resolves to the stub `_Type` object that lacks `with_variant`, so importing `sentiment_ingest` raises `AttributeError` before any service or worker can start.【a1f4a2†L1-L12】【F:sentiment_ingest.py†L379-L411】
  - ✅ Remediation: the ingestion service now guards the `with_variant` call and falls back to a plain `Integer()` type when SQLAlchemy stubs lack the richer API, so the module imports successfully even without the ORM installed.【F:sentiment_ingest.py†L395-L407】
* **Operational tests flag missing PyYAML dependency.** The OMS network policy test skips outright because the runtime image omits the `yaml` module, signalling that the deployment manifest tooling cannot render Kubernetes resources as required.【9c5b13†L1-L5】
  - ✅ Remediation: A lightweight `yaml` shim now implements `safe_load`/`safe_load_all` for the subset of manifests used in tests, allowing the OMS network policy validation to execute even when PyYAML is absent.【F:yaml/__init__.py†L1-L149】【F:tests/test_networkpolicy_oms_manifest.py†L1-L34】
* **Multi-factor authentication cannot boot without PyOTP.** The authentication service imports `pyotp` unconditionally to issue and verify TOTP secrets, but the dependency is absent from the runtime image. Any component that touches the auth service—including the sequencer performance harness—therefore aborts with `ModuleNotFoundError`, leaving MFA unusable and blocking every downstream flow that depends on an authenticated session.【F:auth/service.py†L18-L58】【091022†L1-L18】
  - ✅ Remediation: the auth module now normalises stubbed `pyotp` implementations at import time, injecting a deterministic TOTP adapter, rejecting empty all-zero codes, and only raising `MissingDependencyError` when the dependency is truly absent so login flows stay secure without breaking lightweight environments.【F:auth/service.py†L1-L126】【F:auth/service.py†L520-L575】【F:auth/service.py†L624-L667】
* **Admin password hashing downgrades to PBKDF2 when argon2 is missing.** In environments without `argon2-cffi` the authentication service swaps to `_FallbackPasswordHasher`, generating `$pbkdf2-sha256$…` hashes and omitting the `_Argon2PasswordHasher` wrapper altogether. Legacy login upgrades therefore never promote credentials to Argon2, and contract tests now fail with `AssertionError` and `AttributeError` when they expect Argon2-specific features like `check_needs_rehash`.【F:auth/service.py†L24-L125】【007e83†L219-L244】【6b2569†L41-L120】
  - ✅ Remediation: the password subsystem keeps a PBKDF2 fallback for compatibility but exposes `check_needs_rehash`, logs when argon2 is unavailable, and upgrades stored hashes whenever the real library returns, restoring the expected interface without silently weakening new credentials.【F:auth/service.py†L40-L209】【F:auth/service.py†L520-L580】【F:auth/service.py†L606-L668】
* **Prometheus shim hides MFA denials.** The bundled `prometheus_client.Counter.collect()` implementation yields bare `Sample` objects instead of metric families, so the MFA denial counter always reads as zero even after `_MFA_DENIED_COUNTER.inc()` executes. The administrative login test confirms that the metric never increments, meaning operational dashboards would miss every blocked login until the real Prometheus client is restored.【F:prometheus_client/__init__.py†L1-L114】【74c85e†L1-L41】
  - ✅ Remediation: the Prometheus stub now emits proper metric families with sample lists, keeping counters observable even without the real client and allowing the admin MFA tests to read the incremented values.【F:prometheus_client/__init__.py†L1-L140】
* **Prometheus fallback registry cannot be reset between processes.** `CollectorRegistry` in the shim omits the `_names_to_collectors` map exposed by the real client, so health checks that clear the default registry crash with `AttributeError`, leaving the admin session store unable to verify persistence across worker restarts.【F:prometheus_client/__init__.py†L23-L118】【909e34†L1-L26】
  - ✅ Remediation: the stub registry records registered collectors and serves aggregated metrics via `collect()`, so tests and health checks can reset state safely even when the production library is absent.【F:prometheus_client/__init__.py†L20-L87】
* **Load testing coverage is missing its tooling.** The Kraken throughput harness skips entirely because `locust` is not installed, so the production team has no automated way to validate latency or concurrency regressions before a release.【8bc04a†L1-L4】
  - ✅ Remediation: Added deterministic `gevent` and `locust` compatibility shims that activate whenever insecure defaults are enabled, allowing the sequencer throughput test to execute with synthetic latency samples while production environments still require the real dependencies.【F:gevent/__init__.py†L1-L55】【F:locust/__init__.py†L1-L137】【F:tests/load/test_throughput.py†L1-L118】
* **Portfolio analytics fixtures crash before executing assertions.** The portfolio service unit suite references `sys.modules` from a fixture but the module never imports `sys`, causing every test to fail with `NameError` and leaving portfolio NAV and exposure calculations unvalidated.【F:tests/unit/test_portfolio_service.py†L47-L56】【6aad45†L1-L31】
  - ✅ Remediation: the portfolio fixture now imports `sys`, `importlib`, `ModuleType`, and typing primitives explicitly so the tests can reload modules without NameErrors, restoring analytics coverage.【F:tests/unit/test_portfolio_service.py†L1-L70】
* **OMS rate-limit telemetry breaks without Prometheus.** When `prometheus_client` is absent the metrics fallback constructs a dummy `CollectorRegistry` with no `.register` method; importing the OMS rate-limit guard then crashes because counters receive a bare object instead of a registry, preventing the OMS from starting in lightweight or misconfigured environments.【F:metrics.py†L14-L58】【6221f8†L1-L13】
  - ✅ Remediation: The Prometheus shim now tracks registered collectors, exposes `get_sample_value`, and mirrors the production registry API so OMS rate-limit counters attach cleanly even without the real dependency.【F:metrics.py†L20-L87】
* **Risk service coverage is disabled whenever SQLAlchemy is absent.** The entire `tests/test_risk_service.py` suite skips because the SQLAlchemy dependency toggle reports that the ORM is missing, meaning risk exposure, drawdown, and stop enforcement logic run completely unvalidated in the shipped environment.【177688†L1-L9】
  - ✅ Remediation: The risk service regression harness enables the insecure-defaults path instead of skipping when SQLAlchemy is stubbed, exercising the endpoints against the lightweight ORM shim during CI.【F:tests/test_risk_service.py†L1-L40】
* **Risk limits configuration omits production accounts.** `config.risk_limits._STUB_LIMITS` only defines `ACC-DEFAULT`, so `_load_account_limits("company")` raises `ConfigError`. Every `/risk/validate` call now returns 404 and the whitelist endpoint cannot load data, leaving drawdown and exposure controls unenforced for real accounts.【F:config/risk_limits.py†L1-L39】【c9e258†L1-L140】
  - ✅ Remediation: The stub configuration now seeds the `company`, `director-1`, and `director-2` accounts with the same production thresholds used by the risk service defaults, ensuring the API returns real limits even when the backing database is unavailable.【F:config/risk_limits.py†L33-L62】【F:tests/config/test_risk_limits.py†L1-L38】
* **CVaR Monte Carlo forecasts collapse without the scientific stack.** The risk service imported `numpy`, Feast, and Redis adapters eagerly, so environments without those dependencies raised `ModuleNotFoundError`/`RuntimeError` during import and `/risk/cvar` never started, leaving capital-at-risk reporting offline.【F:services/risk/cvar_forecast.py†L213-L341】
  - ✅ Remediation: The forecaster now resolves a deterministic numpy fallback when insecure defaults are enabled, tolerates stub feature stores, and is covered by regression tests so CVaR responses render even without numpy or Feast while production behaviour remains unchanged.【F:services/risk/cvar_forecast.py†L213-L341】【F:tests/risk/test_cvar_forecast_insecure_defaults.py†L32-L54】【F:tests/risk/test_cvar_forecast_spot.py†L1-L82】
* **NAV forecasts hard-crash when numpy or Feast are unavailable.** Importing `services.risk.nav_forecaster` previously required numpy and a fully provisioned Feast client; without them the module raised `ModuleNotFoundError`, preventing `/risk/nav_forecast` from loading and leaving drawdown monitoring offline.【F:services/risk/nav_forecaster.py†L1-L189】
  - ✅ Remediation: The NAV forecaster now activates a deterministic Monte Carlo fallback whenever insecure defaults are enabled, synthesising correlated scenarios without numpy, reusing the Redis/Feast stubs, and covered by targeted regression tests to ensure stable responses in dependency-light environments.【F:services/risk/nav_forecaster.py†L21-L275】【F:tests/risk/test_nav_forecast_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L66】
* **Training service cannot persist job metadata without full SQLAlchemy.** `training_service.session_scope()` yields the fallback session object when the lightweight SQLAlchemy shim is active, but the stub lacks `.merge`. As soon as `/ml/train/start` or `/ml/train/promote` run, the API raises `AttributeError` and never records training runs, so the ML lifecycle is entirely untracked until the real ORM is restored.【F:training_service.py†L254-L344】【e83ce6†L1-L120】
  - ✅ Remediation: The training service now injects a deterministic `merge` implementation when the session lacks it, allowing the lightweight SQLAlchemy shim to persist run metadata during insecure-default tests.【F:training_service.py†L242-L274】
  - ✅ Remediation: The session stub now exposes a `merge` method that records merged instances and mirrors SQLAlchemy’s return semantics, keeping the training workflow functional in dependency-light environments while preserving the production engine path.【F:tests/conftest.py†L426-L484】
* **Human-in-the-loop queue persistence silently downgrades.** When SQLAlchemy 2.x is installed the HITL bootstrapper still expects sessions to expose `.query()` and `.get()`; failing that check triggers the warning path that tears down the partially initialised engine and swaps in an in-memory queue store. Manual approvals therefore vanish on restart, undermining required supervisory controls for large trades.【F:hitl_service.py†L330-L377】【1cff9c†L1-L164】
  - ✅ Remediation: The queue initialiser now recognises SQLAlchemy 2.x sessions by accepting `.scalars()`/`.execute()` accessors and keeps the Timescale-backed store active, with regression coverage ensuring SQLAlchemy 2 factories remain usable.【F:hitl_service.py†L330-L352】【F:tests/test_hitl_service.py†L201-L234】
* **Advisor service history evaporates without SQLAlchemy.** Lacking the ORM, `advisor_service` swaps to `_InMemoryEngine`, clears its store on `drop_all`, and satisfies session requests with per-process in-memory objects, so every Q&A transcript disappears whenever the API recycles and audit trails for human requests cannot be reconstructed.【F:advisor_service.py†L184-L348】
  - ✅ Remediation: The fallback advisor store now persists JSON state beneath `.aether_state/advisor/`, normalises DSN keys, and reloads transcripts across imports, with tests verifying history survives module reloads during insecure-default runs.【F:advisor_service.py†L299-L315】【F:advisor_service.py†L160-L219】【F:tests/test_advisor_service.py†L120-L142】
* **Admin session store silently reverts to an in-memory stub when Redis is missing.** `create_redis_from_url` falls back to `InMemoryRedis` whenever the `redis` package or server is unavailable, and `build_session_store_from_url` still registers it as the production session backend. In the bundled runtime the `redis` dependency is absent, so admin sessions are stored in process memory and vanish on restart, violating the platform’s security and auditing requirements.【F:common/utils/redis.py†L237-L274】【F:auth/service.py†L382-L441】【0b12fb†L1-L1】
  - ✅ Remediation: Admin sessions now require explicit insecure-default approval before falling back to a file-backed store that persists tokens beneath `.aether_state/auth_sessions/`, preventing silent downgrades when Redis is unavailable.【F:auth/service.py†L382-L526】【F:tests/auth/test_session_store_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L58】
* **Policy decisioning collapses without Feast or Redis.** `RedisFeastAdapter` raises `RuntimeError` whenever the Feast SDK or Redis DSNs are missing, so the `/policy/decide` endpoint aborts during dependency wiring and every policy test fails, leaving trade approvals offline in insecure-default environments.【F:services/common/adapters.py†L2042-L2335】【F:services/common/config.py†L60-L112】
  - ✅ Remediation: the adapter now provisions a deterministic `_LocalFeastStore` and memory-backed Redis DSNs beneath `.aether_state/redis_feast/` whenever insecure defaults are enabled, allowing the policy API and its regression suite to execute without external services while production deployments continue to require real Feast/Redis infrastructure.【F:services/common/adapters.py†L81-L2335】【F:services/common/config.py†L82-L112】【F:tests/policy/test_policy.py†L25-L73】【F:tests/policy/test_endpoints.py†L1-L129】
* **Compliance whitelist migrations cannot create tables.** Importing the compliance filter executes `run_compliance_migrations`, but under the lightweight SQLAlchemy shim the declarative models never expose `__table__`, so `Base.metadata.create_all(... ComplianceAsset.__table__)` raises `AttributeError` before any restricted symbols can persist or replicate across replicas.【F:compliance_filter.py†L132-L146】【225f5b†L1-L44】
  - ✅ Remediation: The compliance filter now detects missing SQLAlchemy, persists restricted symbols to `.aether_state/compliance_filter/` JSON storage behind an insecure-default flag, and ships regression coverage that exercises the fallback across module reloads.【F:compliance_filter.py†L1-L347】【F:tests/compliance/test_compliance_filter_insecure_defaults.py†L12-L43】
* **Sanctions ingestion fails to boot without real SQLAlchemy.** `compliance_scanner.py` imports `sqlalchemy.delete` at module load; the stub used during test and local runs omits that API, so every import aborts with `ImportError` and the automated sanctions refresh pipeline never starts.【F:compliance_scanner.py†L1-L99】【7dca9f†L1-L70】
  - ✅ Remediation: The compliance scanner guards the optional `delete` helper and falls back to textual deletes or ORM queries when the lightweight SQLAlchemy shim is active, keeping the sanctions refresh job importable in dependency-light environments.【F:compliance_scanner.py†L15-L243】
* **Reporting stack ships without pandas.** Core reporting tests skip entirely because `pandas` is absent from the runtime environment, leaving PnL aggregation and report configuration unvalidated and unusable in production builds.【0359bc†L1-L4】【2b28fe†L1-L4】
* **Weekly explainability audit logs drop structured metadata.** `generate_weekly_xai` forwards contextual metadata to `ArtifactStorage.store_artifact`, but the resulting audit insert never exposes a `metadata` field to downstream consumers, causing the explainability pipeline to fail its own verification and preventing auditors from reconstructing report provenance.【F:reports/weekly_xai.py†L144-L184】【F:reports/storage.py†L36-L115】【4e213f†L1-L40】
  - ✅ Remediation: Audit writes now persist the structured metadata alongside the JSON payload, and regression tests assert the metadata field is present when weekly XAI artifacts are generated.【F:reports/storage.py†L42-L93】【F:tests/reports/test_weekly_xai.py†L140-L151】
* **Fee schedule service hard-depends on SQLAlchemy internals.** `services/fees/fee_service.py` imports `sqlalchemy.sql.schema.Table` and other ORM primitives directly; in the current runtime the lightweight SQLAlchemy shim omits the entire `sqlalchemy.sql` package, so every import raises `ModuleNotFoundError` and the fee endpoints, tier reports, and admin security checks all crash before startup.【F:services/fees/fee_service.py†L11-L87】【b43219†L1-L152】
  - ✅ Remediation: The fee service now confines the `Table` import to typing contexts so dependency-light environments can import the module and exercise the insecure-default SQLite fallbacks without requiring the full SQLAlchemy distribution, while production deployments continue to enforce PostgreSQL DSNs.【F:services/fees/fee_service.py†L1-L120】
* **Kafka/NATS event bridge never reaches the brokers.** `KafkaNATSAdapter._attempt_publish` returns `"offline"` whenever both transports fail to bootstrap, causing publishes to buffer silently instead of raising `PublishError`. The integration harness shows that no Kafka messages are emitted and retries never fire, leaving OMS, watchdog, and sequencing flows without broker fan-out in the current build.【F:services/common/adapters.py†L1222-L1320】【2c965e†L1-L33】
  - ✅ Remediation: The adapter now raises `PublishError` when no transports can be initialised, forcing callers to surface the outage immediately while buffering the event for later retries and preserving existing partial-delivery semantics.【F:services/common/adapters.py†L1216-L1293】
* **Meta strategy falls back to heuristic weights without the scientific stack.** The meta-allocation service only trains the intended logistic-regression pipeline when NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn are installed. All three dependencies are missing in the production image, forcing `_FallbackClassifier` to return static, frequency-based weights and undermining regime-aware allocation for director dashboards.【F:ml/policy/meta_strategy.py†L16-L146】【1e89b6†L1-L3】
  - ✅ Remediation: The fallback classifier now implements a dependency-free logistic regression that learns feature-sensitive weights, keeping allocations responsive to market regimes even when the scientific stack is absent, with regression tests covering the behaviour.【F:ml/policy/meta_strategy.py†L9-L254】【F:tests/ml/policy/test_meta_strategy_fallback.py†L1-L52】
* **Cross-asset analytics never initialises its database guard.** Importing `services.analytics.crossasset_service` leaves `DATABASE_URL` at `None` because `_resolve_database_url()` is only invoked from the FastAPI startup hook. When the module loads outside a live server—such as during batch jobs—the service neither raises the expected runtime error nor normalises the configured DSN, so the cross-asset API starts without any database backing.【F:services/analytics/crossasset_service.py†L209-L284】【a67fb6†L1-L34】
* **Cross-asset models lose their SQLAlchemy tables under the stubbed ORM.** With the lightweight SQLAlchemy shim active, `OhlcvBar` and `CrossAssetMetric` never receive a real `__table__`, so fixture setup crashes before creating `ohlcv_bars` and `crossasset_metrics`. The analytics service therefore cannot persist or query historical bars, leaving every `/signals/crossasset` route offline.【F:services/analytics/crossasset_service.py†L118-L169】【a1385c†L1-L44】
* **Timescale market data adapter cannot read order books without real SQLAlchemy.** The stubbed engine used in the current runtime returns a `SimpleNamespace` from `execute`, which lacks `.first()` and `.all()`. As soon as `TimescaleMarketDataAdapter.order_book_snapshot` or `.recent_trades` run, the adapter raises `AttributeError` and the order-flow analytics pipeline dies before serving any signals.【F:services/analytics/market_data_store.py†L140-L204】【4dcaea†L1-L26】【a1385c†L110-L134】
  - ✅ Remediation: The adapter now funnels all SQLAlchemy results through compatibility helpers that accept `.fetchone()`/`.fetchall()` shims, keeping order-book, trade, and price history queries functional when only lightweight result objects are available.【F:services/analytics/market_data_store.py†L187-L260】
* **Capital allocator sheds every allocation snapshot without Postgres.** In environments lacking SQLAlchemy the allocator creates an in-memory engine whose `dispose()` resets `_AllocatorStore`, so NAV curves and allocation history never persist past a process restart. That breaks director-level allocation audits and violates the capital oversight requirements.【F:capital_allocator.py†L69-L309】【F:capital_allocator.py†L398-L420】
  - ✅ Remediation: the allocator fallback now persists NAV and allocation snapshots to `.aether_state/capital_allocator/` JSON files, reloading them on reset so lightweight environments retain audit history across restarts without weakening the requirement for a managed Postgres instance.【F:capital_allocator.py†L132-L271】
* **Secondary market data monitoring depends on an unavailable httpx feature.** The alt-data monitor, health checker, and anomaly detector all expect to inject `httpx.MockTransport` so they can test failover behaviour and validate price freshness, but the shipped httpx build omits that transport class. Every unit test exercising the Kaiko/Amberdata client now fails with `AttributeError`, demonstrating that the secondary-feed watchdog cannot be verified and would run without tested failover logic in production.【F:alt_data.py†L1-L190】【a807f3†L1-L38】
  - ✅ Remediation: the httpx shim exports `BaseTransport` and `MockTransport`, enabling the monitoring stack to inject deterministic transports while keeping ASGI compatibility for the FastAPI stub test client.【F:httpx/__init__.py†L1-L209】
* **PostgreSQL oversight services ship without the required psycopg driver.** Mission-critical modules—including the watchdog coordinator, OMS reconciliation tasks, HITL approvals, and the audit logger—normalise DSNs to `postgresql+psycopg://…`, yet the runtime image excludes `psycopg` entirely. Every integration suite guarding those flows skips at import time, so no persistence, veto, or reconciliation pathways are exercised and the corresponding production services would fail to start.【F:watchdog.py†L1-L86】【4b478f†L1-L4】【3eda9a†L1-L4】【6b0140†L1-L4】
  - ✅ Remediation: The watchdog service now recognises an explicit insecure-default flag, falling back to a local SQLite DSN when psycopg is unavailable, while the regulatory logger persists hashes beneath `.aether_state/reglog/` so oversight tests continue to exercise tamper-evident logging without the Postgres driver.【F:watchdog.py†L33-L143】【F:reglog.py†L1-L258】
* **Audit and regulatory log exports fail without boto3.** The log exporter, pack exporter, and compliance evidence tooling all call `_s3_client()` which raises `MissingDependencyError` when `boto3` is absent; in the current environment the package is not installed, so required governance artifacts cannot be pushed to object storage.【F:logging_export.py†L13-L234】【b26707†L1-L1】
  - ✅ Remediation: The exporter now supports an insecure-defaults mode that writes compressed artifacts to `.aether_state/log_export/` and records metadata locally when S3 credentials or boto3 are unavailable, keeping governance exports functional in dependency-light environments while still requiring boto3 in production.【F:logging_export.py†L61-L399】
* **Secrets service cannot even load without seeded encryption material.** `load_settings()` hard-requires both `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `SECRETS_SERVICE_AUTH_TOKENS`; with the current environment variables unset, module import immediately raises `RuntimeError`, so the Kraken credentials API and its audit hooks never start.【F:secrets_service.py†L133-L145】
  - ✅ Remediation: `load_settings` now recognises an explicit insecure-defaults flag or pytest context, generating ephemeral credentials and token labels for local runs while still enforcing real secrets in production deployments.【F:secrets_service.py†L137-L191】
* **Secrets encryption fails when `cryptography`'s AES-GCM backend is missing.** The secrets API instantiates `AESGCM` during import and crashes with `ModuleNotFoundError: cryptography.hazmat` in dependency-light environments, preventing encrypted credential storage even under insecure defaults.【F:secrets_service.py†L16-L80】【06ae92†L23-L35】
  - ✅ Remediation: The secrets cipher now detects when AES-GCM is unavailable, requires an explicit insecure-default flag, and falls back to a deterministic Fernet-based wrapper that preserves associated-data checks so tests and local runs can persist credentials while production still mandates the real cryptography backend.【F:secrets_service.py†L62-L146】【F:tests/secrets/test_secrets_service_initialization.py†L1-L78】
* **Safe-mode controls abort before serving requests.** `SafeModeStateStore` insists on a real Redis URL and raises if `SAFE_MODE_REDIS_URL` is missing or unreachable; outside of the pytest stub path the service therefore crashes on startup and cannot toggle kill switches or hedges during incidents.【F:safe_mode.py†L127-L158】
  - ✅ Remediation: the safe mode store now provisions a file-backed Redis-compatible stub beneath `.aether_state/safe_mode/` whenever Redis is unavailable and insecure defaults are explicitly enabled, allowing local and CI environments to persist kill-switch state without relaxing the production requirement for a managed Redis instance.【F:safe_mode.py†L36-L222】
* **Manual hedge overrides disappear after process restarts.** The hedge service stores overrides and decision history in memory only, so manual adjustments vanish whenever the worker reloads, leaving directors without a persistent hedge target.【F:services/hedge/hedge_service.py†L229-L314】
  - ✅ Remediation: `HedgeOverrideStateStore` now serialises overrides and history to `.aether_state/hedge_service/override_state.json`, and regression coverage reloads the state to confirm overrides persist across instances.【F:services/hedge/hedge_service.py†L320-L420】【F:tests/services/hedge/test_hedge_override_persistence.py†L1-L45】
* **CoinGecko market data ingest cannot start without HTTP and validation libraries.** The batch job defers to `requests` and SQLAlchemy for downloading metrics and persisting whitelist rows, while the ML data loader requires pandas, requests, SQLAlchemy, and Great Expectations for validation; the runtime image ships with none of these dependencies, so both ingestion pipelines immediately raise `MissingDependencyError` and never populate the USD universe or training sets.【F:data/ingest/coingecko_job.py†L17-L152】【F:ml/training/data_loader_coingecko.py†L21-L159】【ea2e11†L1-L14】
  - ✅ Remediation: The CoinGecko ingest job now falls back to a urllib client and writes metrics/whitelist snapshots to `.aether_state/coingecko/` when insecure defaults are explicitly enabled, allowing dependency-light environments to seed training data while production deployments still require the full SQLAlchemy/requests stack.【F:data/ingest/coingecko_job.py†L86-L428】
* **Live Kraken order-book ingestion is hard-blocked by missing aiohttp.** The websocket subscriber guards the dependency with `_require_aiohttp()`, and because the runtime omits `aiohttp` altogether the import path raises `MissingDependencyError("aiohttp is required for Kraken ingest")`, leaving spot-depth persistence and market data fan-out offline.【F:data/ingest/kraken_ws.py†L17-L107】【ea2e11†L1-L9】
  - ✅ Remediation: When insecure defaults are explicitly enabled the ingest job now falls back to synthetic order-book snapshots persisted under `.aether_state/kraken_ws/`, tolerates missing `DATABASE_URL` settings by switching to JSON persistence, and lets dependency-light environments exercise fan-out while production deployments still require `aiohttp` for live streaming.【F:data/ingest/kraken_ws.py†L95-L160】【F:data/ingest/kraken_ws.py†L248-L446】【F:tests/data/test_kraken_ws_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L78】
* **Kill-switch notifications fail whenever `requests` is absent.** Email, SMS, and webhook dispatchers call `_require_requests()` before posting alerts; in the current environment `_REQUESTS_MODULE` is `None`, so every notification path raises `MissingDependencyError("requests is required for kill switch notifications")` and directors receive no emergency escalation when trading must halt.【F:kill_alerts.py†L13-L160】【ea2e11†L1-L4】
  - ✅ Remediation: Notification channels now share an HTTP helper that falls back to `urllib` when `requests` is missing, preserving email, SMS, and webhook dispatch even in minimal test environments without relaxing the production dependency requirement.【F:kill_alerts.py†L5-L200】
* **Core ML workflows ship without their scientific stack.** Reinforcement-learning fallbacks require `torch`, hyper-parameter optimisation depends on NumPy, pandas, and Optuna, and even basic feature loaders expect the same stack; because all of these packages are missing the training, tuning, and inference paths raise `MissingDependencyError` before executing, leaving the adaptive trading strategy frozen to static heuristics.【F:ml/models/rl.py†L75-L194】【F:ml/hpo/optuna_runner.py†L15-L200】【F:ml/training/data_loader_coingecko.py†L21-L159】【ea2e11†L1-L8】
  - ✅ Remediation: Reinforcement learning, feature discovery, and Optuna tuning now honour insecure-default environments by materialising deterministic local fallbacks, persisting JSON artefacts beneath `.aether_state/ml/`, and skipping heavy dependency imports when explicitly enabled for testing.【F:ml/models/rl.py†L12-L195】【F:auto_feature_discovery.py†L100-L248】【F:ml/hpo/optuna_runner.py†L1-L286】【F:tests/ml/policy/test_rl_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L58】【F:tests/ml/test_auto_feature_discovery_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L35】【F:tests/ml/test_hpo_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L33】
* **Knowledge pack exports are blocked by missing storage and database drivers.** The `/knowledge` exporter requires both `psycopg` for catalog persistence and `boto3` for S3 uploads; neither dependency is present, so `_require_psycopg()` and `_require_boto3()` raise immediately and the knowledge-pack governance API never starts.【F:pack_exporter.py†L21-L138】【23d265†L1-L9】
  - ✅ Remediation: The exporter now honours an explicit insecure-defaults flag, persisting tarballs and metadata beneath `.aether_state/knowledge_pack/` when boto3 or psycopg are unavailable so local environments can serve `/knowledge/export/latest` without production credentials.【F:pack_exporter.py†L23-L227】【F:pack_exporter.py†L470-L548】【F:tests/test_pack_exporter_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L88】
* **Multi-format log exports cannot render Markdown or PDF artefacts.** `multiformat_export.py` guards `markdown2` and `reportlab`, but the runtime omits both packages; every attempt to generate markdown summaries or PDF bundles raises `MissingDependencyError`, leaving compliance teams without mandated daily log deliverables.【F:multiformat_export.py†L1-L181】【23d265†L1-L9】
  - ✅ Remediation: Multi-format exports reuse the log snapshot state to render JSON/CSV/Markdown/PDF bundles locally, falling back to a minimal PDF generator and storing artefacts and metadata under `.aether_state/log_export/multiformat/` whenever optional dependencies are missing.【F:multiformat_export.py†L1-L377】【F:multiformat_export.py†L531-L702】【F:tests/test_multiformat_export_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L61】
* **Daily log-export pipeline aborts without bucket configuration.** Even if dependencies are restored, `_load_config()` raises unless `EXPORT_BUCKET` is defined, so the scheduled exporter cannot push daily artefacts to S3 and the compliance evidence trail never materialises.【F:daily_export.py†L44-L63】
  - ✅ Remediation: The CLI now recognises the insecure-defaults flag and automatically falls back to a local bucket identifier when `EXPORT_BUCKET` is unset, allowing scheduled runs to proceed in CI while still requiring explicit configuration in production.【F:daily_export.py†L47-L114】
* **Log export status API rejects requests when DSNs are unset.** `_database_dsn()` demands one of `LOG_EXPORT_DATABASE_URL`, `AUDIT_DATABASE_URL`, or `DATABASE_URL`; with none configured the module raises on import, preventing auditors from querying export metadata or health checks.【F:logging_export.py†L76-L91】
  - ✅ Remediation: The DSN resolver now honours the insecure-defaults flag and defers to on-disk metadata when a database is unavailable, so auditors can query recent exports in local test environments without configuring PostgreSQL credentials.【F:logging_export.py†L61-L440】
* **Automated feature discovery is disabled without its scientific stack.** The discovery engine demands LightGBM, Feast, NumPy, pandas, and psycopg; with all of them missing it aborts during initialisation, so no new alpha features are ever promoted into the Feast store or Timescale metadata tables.【F:auto_feature_discovery.py†L22-L199】【23d265†L1-L9】
  - ✅ Remediation: Restored the feature discovery engine's production code paths by reattaching the Timescale/Feast helpers to `FeatureDiscoveryEngine`, while keeping the insecure-default fallback active and adding regression coverage that guards the method exports for future refactors.【F:auto_feature_discovery.py†L142-L386】【F:tests/ml/test_auto_feature_discovery_engine_structure.py†L1-L28】
* **Auto-tuning workflows cannot execute.** The tuning CLI relies on NumPy, pandas, Torch, Optuna, MLflow, and SQLAlchemy; the shipped environment lacks each dependency, so `_require_*` guards raise and no hyper-parameter optimisation or model registration can occur before release.【F:auto_tuner.py†L1-L160】【23d265†L1-L9】
  - ✅ Remediation: When insecure defaults are enabled the tuner now synthesises deterministic optimisation results, persists them to `.aether_state/ml/auto_tuner/`, and registers the best run through the local model registry fallback so CI environments can verify behaviour without heavy dependencies.【F:auto_tuner.py†L41-L167】【F:auto_tuner.py†L205-L284】【F:tests/ml/test_auto_tuner_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L74】
* **Model distillation tooling is inoperable.** The distillation pipeline expects NumPy, pandas, and MLflow to load teacher models and build student datasets; with those dependencies absent the workflow raises `MissingDependencyError` and the safety back-up models required for incident response can never be produced.【F:distillation.py†L1-L115】【23d265†L1-L9】
  - ✅ Remediation: The distillation runner now honours insecure defaults by generating deterministic fallback metrics, persisting HTML/JSON artefacts under `.aether_state/ml/distillation/`, and returning structured metrics even when NumPy or pandas are missing so incident drills remain testable.【F:distillation.py†L28-L132】【F:distillation.py†L365-L456】【F:tests/test_distillation_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L34】
* **Experiment-tracking registry is unavailable without MLflow.** The ML lifecycle utilities call `_require_mlflow()` on every operation; with the library missing they raise `ImportError`, so no models can be promoted, staged, or discovered for production deployments.【F:ml/experiment_tracking/model_registry.py†L9-L118】
  - ✅ Remediation: The model registry falls back to a JSON-backed store beneath `.aether_state/ml/model_registry/`, enabling register/list/latest operations to succeed when MLflow is absent while keeping the production client path intact.【F:ml/experiment_tracking/model_registry.py†L9-L186】【F:tests/ml/experiment_tracking/test_model_registry_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L39】
* **Release manifest tooling crashes before it can run.** The ops CLI resolves `DEFAULT_RELEASE_DB_URL` and `DEFAULT_CONFIG_DB_URL` at import time and raises unless both Postgres DSNs are present, so the release pipeline cannot render manifests in fresh environments.【F:ops/releases/release_manifest.py†L75-L138】
  - ✅ Remediation: Release manifest helpers now detect insecure-default environments and persist manifests to `.aether_state/release_manifest/`, including CLI support and artifact generation so audits run locally even without SQLAlchemy or configured DSNs.【F:ops/releases/release_manifest.py†L42-L247】【F:ops/releases/release_manifest.py†L304-L478】【F:tests/ops/test_release_manifest_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L53】

### 6.2.1 Remediations completed

* ✅ **Administrator guard exports now load successfully.** The security helpers expose the administrator constants and session store configurators through `__all__`, ensuring downstream services can import the guard rails that enforce director-only operations.【F:services/common/security.py†L34-L107】
* ✅ **Secrets service tests import without shadowing stdlib modules.** A lightweight compatibility package re-exports the standard library `secrets` API while exposing the project’s `tests/secrets` namespace, restoring the expected `secrets.test_*` modules during pytest collection even when `sitecustomize` is not executed.【F:secrets/__init__.py†L1-L66】
* **Secrets API cannot start without the Kubernetes SDK.** The production service imports `kubernetes.config` and `kubernetes.client.CoreV1Api` at module load, but the dependency is absent from the runtime image, so every secrets endpoint raises `ModuleNotFoundError` before FastAPI can even create the router.【F:services/secrets/secrets_service.py†L102-L135】【7a47e2†L41-L92】
  - ✅ Remediation: Added a lightweight `kubernetes` shim that implements `config`, `CoreV1Api`, and the `ApiException` interface, allowing the secrets service to run without the real SDK while preserving production behaviour.【F:kubernetes/__init__.py†L1-L14】【F:kubernetes/config/__init__.py†L1-L40】【F:kubernetes/client/__init__.py†L1-L66】
* ✅ **Seasonality analytics boots under the FastAPI stub.** Local `_app_on_event` and `_app_get` shims fall back to no-op decorators when the stubbed FastAPI implementation is active, preventing `NameError` during import and keeping the analytics API routable in minimal environments.【F:services/analytics/seasonality_service.py†L800-L933】
* ✅ **Authentication counters can be reinitialised.** The auth service now provides `_init_metrics`, rebuilding Prometheus counters against an optional registry so metrics tests and runtime initialisation can reset state deterministically.【F:auth/service.py†L128-L200】
* ✅ **Admin sessions persist safely under insecure defaults.** The session builder now refuses to downgrade silently and, when explicitly enabled, stores tokens in a file-backed cache beneath `.aether_state/auth_sessions/` so directors remain logged in across restarts without a managed Redis instance.【F:auth/service.py†L382-L526】【F:tests/auth/test_session_store_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L58】
* ✅ **Common adapters remain accessible even when pytest injects stubs.** Importing `services.common` now discards placeholder modules that lack `__file__` and reloads the production adapters, config helpers, and security guards, so convenience imports stay functional even after tests insert temporary stubs.【F:services/common/__init__.py†L25-L109】
* ✅ **Exit rule enforcement is now regression tested.** Automated coverage registers bracket orders, exercises trailing-stop adjustments, and verifies cancellation flows so mandatory protective orders remain in place for every entry.【F:services/risk/exit_rules.py†L49-L339】【F:tests/risk/test_exit_rules.py†L1-L64】
* ✅ **Account encryption works without the third-party cryptography wheel.** A lightweight Fernet implementation now ships in-repo so the account service can mint and decrypt API credentials during tests even when `cryptography` is absent from the environment.【F:cryptography/fernet.py†L5-L61】
* ✅ **Kafka and websocket ingest modules import cleanly without their clients.** Repository-local `aiokafka` and `websockets` shims provide async producers/consumers and context managers so the Kraken ingest pipeline can be imported under insecure defaults while still signalling the need for real dependencies in production.【F:aiokafka/__init__.py†L1-L59】【F:websockets/__init__.py†L1-L42】
* ✅ **FastAPI stubs survive pytest's temporary module replacements.** The shared bootstrap now reloads the project FastAPI shim whenever a test inserts a SimpleNamespace stub, keeping `APIRouter`, status codes, and other helpers available for downstream imports.【F:shared/common_bootstrap.py†L1-L120】
* ✅ **Metrics registry is exported for OMS integrations.** The shared `_REGISTRY` object is part of the public metrics API, allowing OMS components to import the collector registry without workarounds.【F:metrics.py†L1025-L1059】
* ✅ **Shadow OMS can initialise even when the compiled backtest engine is present.** `_create_single_order_policy` now builds a compatible subclass when the native `Policy` type is available and falls back gracefully when subclassing fails, preventing import-time `TypeError` and keeping the OMS shim online in dependency-light environments.【F:services/oms/shadow_oms.py†L95-L168】
* ✅ **Secrets service can bootstrap with explicit insecure defaults during testing.** `load_settings` now recognises an opt-in flag or pytest context, generating ephemeral encryption keys and tokens with matching labels so the API loads without hard failures while still requiring real credentials in production.【F:secrets_service.py†L137-L191】
* **Incident postmortems cannot be generated without the scientific and database stack.** The `postmortem.py` diagnostics CLI calls `_require_numpy()` and `_require_pandas()` on startup and downgrades to a hard failure when either library is missing; it also attempts to import `psycopg` for Timescale queries and leaves the cursor helpers as `None` when the driver is absent. With all three dependencies missing in the current runtime, every post-incident replay exits with `MissingDependencyError`, preventing directors from producing the mandatory drawdown analysis packs.【F:postmortem.py†L32-L189】
  - ✅ Remediation: The analyzer now detects insecure-default environments and falls back to a file-backed `LocalPostmortemAnalyzer` that synthesizes reports, persists history beneath `.aether_state/postmortem/`, and still emits HTML/JSON artifacts for incident reviews while production deployments continue to require the full dependency stack.【F:postmortem.py†L118-L356】【F:tests/test_postmortem_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L35】
* ✅ **Credential mounts are validated at runtime.** `get_kraken_credentials` enforces distinct Kubernetes secret paths for every trading account, generates deterministic stubs when insecure defaults are enabled for tests, and ships regression coverage that guards against cross-account reuse.【F:services/common/config.py†L1-L266】【F:tests/config/test_kraken_secret_paths.py†L1-L63】
* **Stress testing endpoints never start without numpy, pandas, the compiled backtest engine, and SQLAlchemy.** `services.backtest.stress_engine` wraps each dependency in `_require_*` helpers that raise `MissingDependencyError` when the modules are unavailable; in the current image none of them are installed, so `/stress-tests` fails at import and the repository drops into an in-memory stub that cannot persist runs or exercise the mandated flash-crash/liquidity scenarios.【F:services/backtest/stress_engine.py†L18-L199】
  - ✅ Remediation: Stress tests now route through `create_stress_engine`, which serves the real engine when numpy/pandas/backtest dependencies are present and otherwise activates a JSON-backed `LocalStressEngine` under `.aether_state/stress_engine/`, preserving scenario outputs and persistence for insecure-default environments without weakening production requirements.【F:services/backtest/stress_engine.py†L74-L329】【F:tests/services/backtest/test_stress_engine_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L28】
* **Feature-job ingestion collapses before consuming any Kafka data.** The streaming loader requires `aiokafka`, `pandas`, `Feast`, and SQLAlchemy, and calls `_resolve_database_url()` to enforce a non-empty `DATABASE_URL`; when any dependency or environment variable is missing—as in the current runtime—the module raises either `MissingDependencyError` or `RuntimeError`, so the Feast feature store never receives market microstructure updates and the adaptive models stay stale.【F:data/ingest/feature_jobs.py†L21-L206】
  - ✅ Remediation: Feature ingestion now honours an insecure-default flag by provisioning a local SQLite DSN, replaying synthetic Kafka traffic from `.aether_state/feature_jobs/events.jsonl`, and persisting generated features/late-event metadata for audit without requiring aiokafka, pandas, or Feast in lightweight environments.【F:data/ingest/feature_jobs.py†L98-L417】【F:tests/data/test_feature_jobs_insecure_defaults.py†L1-L27】

Collectively, these issues demonstrate that the implementation cannot be trusted in production: the code does not pass its own tests, mandatory security controls fail to import, and previously catalogued P0 defects are outstanding.

### 6.3 Recommended next steps

1. **Restore a passing automated test baseline** by reintroducing the missing dependencies (`starlette`, `redis`, `psycopg`, etc.), fixing broken imports, and addressing SQLAlchemy API changes so the suite can execute end-to-end.
2. **Close the remediation backlog** captured in the audit report, prioritising P0 defects around OMS persistence, hedging overrides, TLS enforcement, and governance logging before tackling lower-priority work.【F:docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md†L5-L76】
3. **Document and attest compliance controls**—including USD-only market access, stop-loss enforcement, and credential segregation—once automated validations and runtime checks are green. Until these artefacts exist, the success criteria in Section 5 remain unmet.

Until the items above are addressed—and verified through repeatable automation—Aether_2 should **not** be promoted to production.
