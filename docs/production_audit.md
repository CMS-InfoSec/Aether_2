# Aether_2 Production Readiness & Security Audit

_Date:_ 2025-10-07 (UTC)

## ✅ Fully Functional Components
- **Spot Instrument Enforcement** – Shared spot utilities normalise symbols, reject leverage keywords/suffixes, and expose HTTP helpers ensuring only USD spot pairs are accepted across services.【F:shared/spot.py†L1-L115】【F:services/common/spot.py†L1-L42】
- **Risk-Based Position Sizing** – Risk service queries balances, feeds account context into the `PositionSizer`, and records diagnostics for audit trails, ensuring position sizes stay within NAV, cash, and volatility-aware limits.【F:risk_service.py†L820-L895】
- **Adaptive Position Sizer** – Position sizing enforces spot-only inputs, volatility floors, risk budgets, and precision-aware lot sizing before returning limits with telemetry for governance.【F:services/risk/position_sizer.py†L1-L200】
- **Authentication & RBAC** – Auth service requires external OAuth/OIDC providers, MFA, and persists JWT-backed sessions. Shared security middleware enforces admin/director roles and consistent header validation.【F:auth_service.py†L1-L200】【F:services/common/security.py†L1-L200】
- **Simulation Safety Controls** – Simulation service requires admin authentication, publishes transitions to the event bus, and records audit logs, preventing live trading when `sim` mode is active.【F:sim_mode.py†L1-L129】

## ⚠️ Fixed or Patched Items
- **Removed Margin Endpoint Usage** – `resync_positions` no longer calls Kraken’s `/private/OpenPositions` (margin-only), preventing accidental exposure of credentials to derivatives APIs and ensuring spot-only compliance. The REST client now raises an explicit error if the method is invoked.【F:services/oms/oms_service.py†L1012-L1025】【F:services/oms/kraken_rest.py†L119-L124】

## ❌ Remaining Issues & Mitigations
1. **Historical Margin Helpers** – Residual parsing helpers such as `_parse_rest_open_positions` remain in the OMS service for backwards compatibility. _Mitigation:_ remove unused parsing logic and add regression tests to ensure no caller relies on margin-specific payloads.【F:services/oms/oms_service.py†L1258-L1271】
2. **Unverified Kubernetes Hardening** – Deployment manifests were not exercised in-cluster during this audit; TLS enforcement, NetworkPolicies, and resource limits require staging validation. _Mitigation:_ run `helm template`/`kubectl diff` against staging and capture evidence of TLS, resource bounds, and restricted egress before production cutover.
3. **Dependency Governance** – `requirements.txt` and `poetry.lock` include numerous pinned packages but lack automated CVE scanning. _Mitigation:_ integrate `pip-audit`/`safety` into CI and align dependencies with latest security patches prior to deployment.

## Spot-Only Compliance Summary
- No Kraken futures, margin, swap, or perpetual endpoints are referenced; new safeguards prevent REST usage of margin-only endpoints.【F:services/oms/kraken_rest.py†L119-L124】【F:services/oms/oms_service.py†L1012-L1025】
- Symbol pipelines reject leverage, derivatives, and non-USD quotes globally through shared validation utilities.【F:shared/spot.py†L17-L115】
- Position sizing, risk checks, and OMS integrations enforce spot-only symbols before any order orchestration.【F:risk_service.py†L820-L895】【F:services/risk/position_sizer.py†L114-L200】

## Production Readiness Grade
**B** – Core services, risk controls, and authentication are production-ready with strong spot-only enforcement. Remaining operational gaps involve infrastructure validation and dependency governance; address outstanding mitigations to reach Grade **A**.

## Recommended Monitoring & Alerting
- **OMS**: Order submit/ack latency, REST/WS throttle hit rates, request error counts by Kraken endpoint.
- **Risk**: Position sizing rejection counts, NAV drawdown trajectory, volatility regime changes.
- **Auth**: Login success/failure ratios, MFA challenge errors, session issuance latency.
- **Simulation**: Mode transitions, actor/audit logs, divergence between sim and live OMS flows.
- **Compliance**: Non-spot instrument rejection metrics, sanctions screening outcomes, admin action audit trails.
- **Infrastructure**: Pod restarts, resource saturation, TLS certificate expiry, NetworkPolicy violations.
