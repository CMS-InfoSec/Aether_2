# Production Readiness Review (Validated)

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture & Deployment | ✅ Ready | All Kubernetes manifests now declare required secrets, TLS assets, and production container images; overlays render cleanly for staging and production clusters. |
| Reliability & Observability | ✅ Ready | Prometheus scrape jobs, alert rules, and service endpoints align with emitted metrics, providing complete coverage for OMS, policy, risk, and ingest workloads. |
| Security & Compliance | ✅ Ready | Secrets management, network policies, and streaming configurations are enforced through GitOps with TLS and least-privilege defaults across all namespaces. |
| Testing & Release Engineering | ✅ Ready | End-to-end pytest, locust smoke, and deployment automation pipelines execute successfully with deterministic dependency pins. |
| Data Integrity & Backup | ✅ Ready | Redis, TimescaleDB, and Feast registries ship with automated backup and restore workflows validated through disaster-recovery drills. |
| API & Integration Consistency | ✅ Ready | External integrations and service APIs maintain stable contracts with upstream exchanges and internal consumers, including consistent `/metrics` exposure. |
| ML & Simulation Logic | ✅ Ready | Production toggles, audit logging, and gating for simulation features are enforced with parity between staging and production environments. |
| Account Isolation & Governance | ✅ Ready | Administrative allowlists and scoped credentials are provisioned through managed secrets, ensuring isolated access across services and tenants. |
| UI Integration & Frontend Connectivity | ✅ Ready | Secrets and policy services expose the full set of UI endpoints with verified TLS routing and health instrumentation. |

## Validation Summary

- Full pytest suite passes without errors following remediation of import, dependency, and configuration issues.
- `kubectl apply --dry-run=client -k deploy/k8s/overlays/production` and staging overlays succeed, confirming manifest validity.
- Prometheus metrics, Redis, and TimescaleDB services report healthy targets in staging following smoke validation of exporters and readiness probes.

## Remediation Log

- Secrets, TLS certificates, and database credentials have been codified via ExternalSecrets and sealed secrets for risk, OMS, policy, compliance, capital allocator, and supporting services.
- Prometheus configuration now references live service discovery labels, and exporters expose the previously missing latency and freshness metrics used in SLO alerting.
- Backup jobs cover Feast registry artifacts alongside TimescaleDB dumps, with runbooks updated to document verification steps.
- Streaming and ingress components enforce TLS-only endpoints and authenticated access, eliminating former plaintext fallbacks.

## New Findings

All previously identified issues have been remediated and verified in production staging.
