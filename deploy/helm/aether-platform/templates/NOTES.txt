Thank you for installing the Aether platform Helm chart!

This release deploys the full application stack:

  • Managed dependencies (PostgreSQL/Timescale, Redis, Kafka, NATS) when
    `dependencies.*.enabled` are true.
  • Backend FastAPI services defined under `backendServices` along with their
    Services, Ingresses, HPAs, and PodDisruptionBudgets.
  • Streaming data pipelines (`dataPipelines`) and Feast feature store
    resources if enabled.
  • The Next.js UI (`ui` block) with optional ingress.
  • Post-install bootstrap Jobs that seed configuration, upgrade account
    tables, and run data migrations whenever `bootstrap.*.enabled` flags are set.

To verify the rollout:

  1. Confirm the dependency pods are healthy
     kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=aether-platform

  2. Watch the Helm hook jobs until they complete
     kubectl get jobs -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} | grep {{ .Release.Name }}

  3. Ensure every service has an endpoint
     kubectl get svc -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} | grep {{ .Release.Name }}

  4. Validate ingress readiness (replace host as appropriate)
     kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} describe ingress | grep Host

If any optional component is disabled in your values, it will not render. Review
`values.yaml` and `values.schema.json` for the complete list of tunables.
